# Scheme manpages

This project aims to be a collection of manpages for the programming
language Scheme. The goal is to include all of R6RS and R7RS.

To write portable Scheme code is necessary to know the language itself
and the variations that exist in its implementations. The manpage
format makes it possible to include much more detail than is usual for
the Scheme reports.
