.SH NAME
call-with-bytevector-output-port \- call a procedure with a bytevector output port
.
.SH LIBRARY
.nf
.BR "(import (rnrs))" "                     ;R6RS"
.BR "(import (rnrs io ports))" "            ;R6RS"
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.BI "(call-with-bytevector-output-port " proc )
.BI "(call-with-bytevector-output-port " proc " " maybe-transcoder )
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates an output port that accumulates the bytes written to it and
calls
.I proc
with that output port as an argument.
.
Whenever
.I proc
returns, a bytevector consisting of all of the port's accumulated
bytes (regardless of the portâ€™s current position) is returned and the
port is closed.
.PP
The transcoder associated with the output port is determined as for a
call to
.BR open-bytevector-output-port (3scm).
.
\" .SH "IMPLEMENTATION NOTES"
\" .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.
Returns a single value; a bytevector.
.
.SH EXAMPLES
.
.EX
(call-with-bytevector-output-port
  (lambda (p)
    (put-u8 p 7)))
        => #vu8(7)

(call-with-bytevector-output-port
  (lambda (p)
    (put-string p "0123"))
  (native-transcoder))
        => #vu8(48 49 50 51)
.EE
.
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
.
This procedure is commonly used when creating bytevectors piecemeal.
.
\" .SH RATIONALE
\" .
.SH COMPATIBILITY
.
This procedure is unique to R6RS. It is a wrapper around
.BR open-bytevector-output-port (3scm).
.
.SH ERRORS
This procedure can raise exceptions with the following condition types:
.TP
.BR &assertion " (R6RS)"
The wrong number of arguments was passed or an argument was outside its domain.
In particular,
.I proc
must be a procedure that can accept one argument, and
.I maybe-transcoder
must be a transcoder or \f[CR]#f\fP.
.

.SH STANDARDS

.
.SH HISTORY
.
This procedure is new to the reworked I/O in R6RS.
